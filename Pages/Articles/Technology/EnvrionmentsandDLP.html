                    Apple came out in support of California’s “Right-to-repair” law which is the company’s latest stance in its involvement in California’s legislative saga with the tech company. From technical news source, The Verge, “The right-to-repair movement is just getting started”, Governor Gavin Newsom last month signed into law the “Right to Repair Act” which guarantees everyone access to parts, tools, and manuals needed to repair electronics and was initially voiced against by Apple. This creates challenges faced by independent repair professionals and right-to-repair advocates, despite recent legislative victories in California, Minnesota, and New York. Apple’s support of the law was surprising given that independent repairs affect Apple’s bottom line and intellectual property.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    While bottom line profits are one area of concern, Apple and other tech companies, such as Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Tesla, oppose the legislation because it infringes on intellectual property rights, creates a concern for safety, and could potentially damage their reputations. The opposition, however, is seen as a hindrance to creating a more sustainable and repair-friendly tech ecosystem. So why is Apple’s support for this bill surprising? Simply put, Apple's commitment to repair may be more about complying with legislation than a fundamental shift in its design philosophy.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The whole goal of the bill is aimed at reducing environmental impacts from e-waste, in particular reducing the contributing carbon emissions and resource depletion from electronic waste that accumulates in landfills. It also attempts to level the playing field for independent repairs between device manufacturers and everyone else.
                </p>

                <blockquote class="quote">
                    <p><span><i class="ri-double-quotes-l"></i></span> Despite the environmental benefits of increased repair access, some of the world’s biggest tech companies, including Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Tesla, have spent millions convincing lawmakers not to support it. Manufacturers cite a range of reasons for their opposition: right to repair will infringe on their intellectual property rights; consumers will injure themselves fixing their stuff; independent repair will lead to more hacking; and shoddy repairs will damage companies’ reputations. John Deere has even claimed that greater repair access will allow farmers to tamper with the emissions controls on their tractors in violation of the Clean Air Act — a notion the Environmental Protection Agency recently refuted. <span><i class="ri-double-quotes-r"></i></span></p>
                </blockquote>
            
                <p>
                    Repair advocates and lawmakers argue that these claims are baseless and that the real reason is the impact on bottom line profits. To hinder independent repair, tech giants make it challenging to fix devices through design choices by soldering components directly to logic boards, parts pairing which makes it difficult to refurbish devices, the use of proprietary screws, and utilizing glued-in batteries, all of these design choices create physical barriers to repair. Software support is another critical factor, as manufacturers discontinuing updates can render devices obsolete. Software locks pose significant threats to the refurbishment business model, making it more challenging for professionals to salvage and restore devices. However, tech companies are starting to realize they may be on the losing side; Apple launched the first self-repair programs in 2022, Microsoft released a study promoting independent repairs, and Samsung and Google announced partnerships with iFixit, a company that provides online resources for DIY-ers. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The article by Verge, “The right-to-repair movement is just getting started”, presents a complex landscape where legislative victories are celebrated, but challenges persist due to manufacturer practices, design choices, and the need for more comprehensive regulations. It’s an ongoing struggle and there is a call for nationwide legislation in the United States. There needs to be a way to ensure transparency and fair market competition. EU’s ecodesign regulation mandates manufacturers design products to meet standards which promote a more environmentally conscious approach to product development and it would be interesting to see if something similar would be passed in the United States and how it would affect both device manufacturers and independent repairers.
